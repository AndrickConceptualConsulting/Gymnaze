# Privacy Policy UI Fixes - Complete ✅

## Changes Made

### Font Color Fix in Contact Information Box
- **Issue**: Text in the blue contact information box had poor contrast
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed heading and body text color to `color: 'white'`
  - Updated email links to use `color: 'warning.main'` with `fontWeight: 600` for better visibility

### Email Address Updates
- **Changed from**: `privacy@gymnaze.com` 
- **Changed to**: `web@gymnaze.com`
- **Applied to**:
  - Contact information box email
  - "Contact Us About Privacy" button

### Button Text Update
- **Changed from**: "Contact Privacy Team"
- **Changed to**: "Contact Us About Privacy"
- **Reason**: More accurate since there's no dedicated privacy team

### Text Improvements
- Fixed apostrophe escaping for JSX compatibility
- Maintained accessibility and readability
